# Cortex

Smart contracts open up new attack surfaces. Their machine-code, storage, and any interactions with them are public. Cortex takes smart contracts apart, analyses them & tries to extract value from them.

For examples, see https://cortex.minesec.net/symbolic.html#_symbolic_explorer.

## Documentation

The documentation is generated by Maven, partially during test execution.

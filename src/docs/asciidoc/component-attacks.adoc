// Explain area is largely in development
// Explain example scenarios using actual Cortex programs
// Explain expected path-finding: bruteforcing approach, path validation. path elimination
//                                refer to Coverage-Guided Fuzzing
//                                refer to Graph Flow analysis
// Explain Target-finding ( Targets being instructions used to move a program into a desired state. )
// Explain "Attacker" (offline & online)
// Example of block constraints | data flow composed into a composite constraint
// Example of path to a CALL & a solution found

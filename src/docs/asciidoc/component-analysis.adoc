== Analysis

=== Description

Analysis within Cortex is a process in which instructions are converted to a Graph, which during analysis is enriched with additional details represented as Edges.
An Edge is be any information bound either to the Graph or from the Graph to instructions or blocks of instructions.

Notable example of Graph Edges adding information and optimization passes can be found in the paragraphs below.

Take for example the following instructions:

// Example of PUSH PUSH MULTIPLY HASH

// Explain the future Graph and Edges approach with Known data & Known Constraints (ie 2018 <= DATE <= 2020)

=== Processors

// Ideally briefly describe each processor using documentation table from a test

=== Optimizing Processors

// Explain the purpose of optimization

// Example of PUSH PUSH MULTIPLY HASH

// Explain the future Graph and Edges approach with Known data & Known Constraints (ie 2018 <= DATE <= 2020)

=== Flow Processors

// Explain control flow

// Test Example of visualized control flow:

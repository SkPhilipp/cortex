Blockchain-based programs ("smart contracts") open up new attack surfaces. Their compiled code must be small, and public. Their storage space must be
publicly readable, and every interaction with them must be recoded.

Cortex aims to be the system to analyse such software, find desired paths within them & even move them to such desired states.

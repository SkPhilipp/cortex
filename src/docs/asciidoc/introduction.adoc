== Abstract

Cortex is a system to analyse software, find desired paths within them & move them to a desired state. The project consists of the following components:

=== Components

[cols="3,10"]
|====
| Component | Purpose
| Context | Virtual environment within which instructions may be executed.
| Instructions | Forms programs, which may be executed within a context.
| Tree | Representation of instructions, usable for analysis. Trees contain optimizations which simplify analysis.
| Fuzzer | Generates random programs, used in automated testing of optimizations.
| Jump Mapper | Maps out the transitions between nodes of a tree, which are later used to find a path to a targeted state.
| Target Finder | Finds a instructions which may be used to move a program into a desired state.
| Path Finder | Finds technically possible paths to targeted instructions.
| Validator | Finds out which paths to a targeted instruction can feasibly be reached and provides the conditions and inputs needed to move programs to the desired state.
| Attacker | Actively tries to move given programs to a desired state.
| Connected Attacker | Actively tries to move all publicly published programs to a desired state.

=== Terminology

[cols="3,10"]
|====
| Name | Definition
| unknown | An unconstrained value.
| constrained | A value which has constraints applied to it. An high-level example of this is: `if(x < 3) { win(x) }`.  Within the body of the `if` statement, `x` has a constraint of `x < 3`.
| known | A value which can be determined ahead of time. An example of this is the current time. Known values include constraint-inferred values; An integer value with constraints `0 < value < 2` is known to be `1`, as it can only be `1`.
| self-contained | A node part of a tree which can be full precomputed ahead of time.

== Virtual Machine

=== Description

The Cortex virtual machine is a component in which executables using the Cortex instruction set can be executed. The full instruction set is documented by the APIs below.
The main purpose of the virtual machine and instruction set is to be able to define and simulate behaviour of compiled smart contracts,
such as those available on the Ethereum or Bitcoin blockchains.

Notably, Virtual Machines also support the following;
- Snapshots; storing and loading a Virtual Machine to and from disk
- Branching and Rollbacks; a Virtual Machine can be copied entirely with nearly no memory overhead; for example to explore different execution paths

=== Examples

// Executing some basic instructions and its resulting output

// Performing a CALL and its resulting output

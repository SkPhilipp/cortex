== Connected System Design

The system should have the ability to:
- Map network-specific programs to Cortex assembly
- Run against a local network
- Run against the test network
- Run against the live network
- Deduplicate programs with equivalent assembly
- Allow for clustered solving
- Warn when especially difficult programs are found for manual analysis

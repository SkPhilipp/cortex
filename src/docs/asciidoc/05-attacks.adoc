=== Barrier Programs

Barrier programs are short programs used to measure the capabilities of Cortex.
This chapter contains the barrier programs which Cortex should be able to solve, or are on the roadmap to be solved.

=== Attack Generators

Below is a demonstration of Cortex analysing and finding the solution to barrier programs, available also is the
time it took for Cortex to construct the solution.

Cortex will try to reach `HALT WINNER`, or `CALL` with a recipient address of `1234`.

=== Exploration

Below is a demonstration of Cortex navigating through possible paths of barrier programs, using purely symbolic execution.

Per barrier program a solution for the first path ending in `HALT WINNER` has also been documented.

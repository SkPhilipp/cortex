== Attacks

=== Attack Generators

Below is a demonstration of Cortex analysing and finding the solution to an example program.
The pseudocode for this program is:

```
if(args[1] / 2 == 12345) {
    HALT WINNER
}
```

Cortex will try to reach `HALT WINNER`.

=== Barrier Programs

Barrier programs are short programs used to measure the capabilities of Cortex.
Below are some sample programs which Cortex should be able to solve, or are on the roadmap to be solved.

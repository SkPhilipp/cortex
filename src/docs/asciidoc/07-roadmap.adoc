== Roadmap

=== Improvements

* Proper representation of Hash functions in solving layer
* A customizable strategy for finding successful SymbolicVirtualMachines, to mark them as such during execution
   - This should allow for further constraints to be applied (To for example control a CALLs'; `Equals(callAddressStackElement, Value(1234))`)
* Barrier program which calls itself
* Refactor symbolic references to allow named variables (such as start time), as well as program-context bound named variables (such as caller address)

=== Product

* Given a self-made minimal contract's handle, extract and solve, then perform the call to extract on the test network.

=== Concept Documents

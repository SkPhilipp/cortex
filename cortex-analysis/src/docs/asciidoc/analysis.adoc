= Cortex Analysis Capabilities

Analysis within Cortex is a process in which instructions are converted to a graph. Such a graph
contains edges, which represent additional information, generally linked to one or more instructions.

The analysis process is split into separate pieces known as processors.
A processor receives the graph and can make any modification to to the graph,
such as adding edges and replacing instructions.

== Attacks

=== Attack Generators

Below is a demonstration of Cortex analysing and finding the solution to barrier programs.
This method works by planning a path through the program without executing it,
then calculating and solving the constraints required to get to the targeted point in the program.

Cortex will try to reach `HALT WINNER`, or `CALL` with a recipient address of `1234`.

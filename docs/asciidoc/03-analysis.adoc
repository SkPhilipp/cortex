== Analysis

Analysis within Cortex is a process in which instructions are converted to a graph. Such a graph
contains edges, which represent additional information, generally linked to one or more instructions.

The analysis process is split into separate pieces known as processors.
A processor receives the graph and can make any modification to to the graph,
such as adding edges and replacing instructions.

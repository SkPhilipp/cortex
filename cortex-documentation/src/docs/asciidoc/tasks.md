implement tests for
symbolic bitwise operations some have TODOs on them
optimizations on symbolic bitwise operation expressions
implement something that verifies the barrier program solutions for both regular attacker and symbolic method
that includes our custom barrier program opcodes as well as the solidity-compiled ones
todo's in expression optimizer

a barrier program that sends the full balance to the message sender
part of ethereum barrier test

assert ethereum barriers currently solved stay solved
use the solutions to run an attack to verify the solutions are correct
find out whether any unsolved barriers are unsolved in other tests

Set up a server to build, maybe even pay for bitbucket pipelines to the documentation
can be updated from not the current machine. Ping discord or Slack or
something when it's done

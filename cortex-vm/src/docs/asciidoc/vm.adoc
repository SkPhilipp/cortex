= Cortex Virtual Machine

The Cortex virtual machine can execute Cortex instruction set compatible programs.
The virtual machine and instruction set are used to define and simulate behaviour of compiled smart contracts,
such as those available on the Ethereum or Bitcoin blockchains.

Notably, the virtual machine also supports snapshots, and in-memory copies at near-zero memory cost.

== Barrier Programs

Barrier programs are short programs used to measure the capabilities of Cortex.
This chapter contains the barrier programs which Cortex should be able to solve, or are on the roadmap to be solved.

[12:12 AM] ?: memory, has a history
memory[0] is memory[0] until it is overwritten
at that point it simply becomes memory[0], 2
any reference from that point on should refer to memory[0], 2, not memory[0]
does that solve the problem?

maybe
[12:15 AM] ?: this would be in essence a "write counter" with a potential optimization being to not increment it when the same value is written,.. i think?
[12:18 AM] ?: with this method saves can be supported, as long as the address to save to is known, if that is not known it becomes more difficult and we may
have to infer a range or uniqueness of the index, for example for SHA1(x) and SHA1(y) where x and y are not known, we only need to know whether they are equal to say that the memory address they write to is unique

this could also become a constraint, and we can simply "assume" uniqueness" or "not assume uniqueness" and go forward, not caring either way. then it becomes a path constraint!
